== About this book

_Bitcoin Development Philosophy_ is a guide for new Bitcoin developers
who already understand the basics of concepts and processes such as Proof-of-Work, block
building, and the transaction life cycle, and who want to level up by
gaining a deeper understanding of Bitcoin's design trade-offs and
philosophy. It should help new developers absorb the most important
lessons of over a decade of Bitcoin development and discussion, and provide
a context for evaluating new ideas (good ones and bad ones!).

=== What to expect?

Bitcoin is a huge subject and we couldn't possibly cover all of its aspects here. Nevertheless, we
hope to discuss the necessary features to get you started as well as to enable you to further explore it on your own.

There are lots of people involved in Bitcoin; as some of them have opposing opinions,
there are resources that express contradictory ideas. However, we always
attempt to stick to the facts, where opinions do not matter.

=== Who wrote this?

The main authors of this book are Kalle Rosenbaum and Linn√©a Rosenbaum. This work
was commissioned and funded by Chaincode Labs, a development center that runs educational
programs for developers who want to https://learning.chaincode.com/[learn] about Bitcoin development.

=== How is this organized?

The project is sectioned into chapters covering different topics. Each
chapter will guide you through a number of links to articles or
videos that we recommend reading, and will briefly discuss each
link. The reported material was written by individuals who have
studied Bitcoin development for a long time.

The links refer to external resources on platforms we cannot
control. We have therefore saved the linked articles locally in this
repository, along with info on where it was copied from, and when. The
resources are collected in link:sources/sources.html[a separate
document] (`sources/sources.adoc`) and organized by the chapter they are
linked from. The links found in the chapters refer to the original
sources, but if you don't have an internet connection, the links
appear dead, or the content seems severely changed, you can read the
content locally instead.
